  Temporary files like web pages and online media are stored in the cache. Doing so speeds up the web browsing experience. Easier for the web browser to load a saved file than to load a new copy of the website or page.
  This can cause the popup to not appear properly. Also web developers have to make updates to the files that comprise your site in order to push a change or new feature live. If we change a file that your browser has cached, it’s going to keep serving the old, cached version of the file and you won’t see our most recent changes
